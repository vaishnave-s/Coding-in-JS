// First Come First Serve - If your application makes use of a queueing system for requests, then quite obviously the queue structure becomes applicable for use.
// Breadth First Search - During search, a queue can be used to store nodes that are to be processed. During processing, the adjacent node is added to a queue to allow processing in the same order that they are viewed.
// Cache - The LRU cache implementation is essentially a queue structure, whilst a queue is not efficient enough on itâ€™s own, one can be used to keep the order of cache items.

//First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
